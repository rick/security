# Security bullet list

What actions can you take that can do the most to improve your digital security?

For some good background information, check out the Electronic Frontier Foundation's [Surveillance Self-Defence](https://ssd.eff.org/) docs. There's even a fairly comprehensive guide for [activists and protestors](https://ssd.eff.org/en/playlist/activist-or-protester).

There is a more detailed document focusing on strategies for securing your computer [here](guidelines.md).

## Smartphones

 - [ ] Enable an unlock code or passphrase on your phone, preferably more than 4 digits.
 - [ ] Enable encryption on your phone. [iphone](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-encrypt-your-iphone), [android](https://www.howtogeek.com/141953/how-to-encrypt-your-android-phone-and-why-you-might-want-to/)
 - [ ] Install an encrypted communications applications (e.g., [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/)) and move to using this for SMS and phone calls when communicating about sensitive issues.
 - [ ] Turn off location services on your phone for photos. (Posting photos to social media can identify where you live, work, meet, protest, etc.).
 - [ ] Consider removing social media applications from your phone (facebook, twitter, instagram, snapchat, etc.); get in the habit of communicating by other means; be intentional about what you post to social media, and where you post from.
 - [ ] Read up on information related to [attending protests in the USA](https://ssd.eff.org/en/playlist/activist-or-protester#attending-protests-united-states).
   - [ ] Consider pulling your phone battery or SIM card if you are attending a protest where surveillance is likely.


## Computers

 - [ ] Enable a [strong password](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/choosing_secure_1.html) on your computer. Booting up your computer should require a password. Unlocking your screen saver should require a password. Get in the habit of locking your screen whenever you are not sitting at it.
 - [ ] Encrypt your computer hard drive.
    - [Apple FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837)
    - For Microsoft Windows, the story is more complicated:
      - "[Encrypting Windows Hard Drives](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/06/encrypting_wind.html)"
      - "[Microsoft may have your encryption key; hereâ€™s how to take it back](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/microsoft-may-have-your-encryption-key-heres-how-to-take-it-back/)"
 - [ ] Install a [virus scanner](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372364,00.asp) if you use Microsoft Windows.
 - [ ] Get and use a password manager such as [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/). Use strong unique passwords for every account.
 - [ ] Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your email accounts, DropBox (or Box) account, bank accounts, any domain name registrars.
 - [ ] Install browser tools to disable plugins, ads, and tracking:
   - Chrome:
     - [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/)
     - [Flashcontrol](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flashcontrol/mfidmkgnfgnkihnjeklbekckimkipmoe?hl=en)
     - [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/try-us/download-browser-extension/)
     - [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
     - [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en)
     - [Vanilla Cookie Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vanilla-cookie-manager/gieohaicffldbmiilohhggbidhephnjj?hl=en)
 - [ ] Sign up for [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) for secure email communications.

### Guidelines

 - [ ] Use your password manager for all passwords. Make strong unique passwords for every account you use.
 - [ ] Don't share accounts, don't share passwords, don't write down passwords.
 - [ ] Be extremely careful with links received by email. Go to the site in question by typing in the relevant URL, rather than clicking an email link.
 - [ ] Use SSL everywhere. Use your password manager to fill in passwords. If the password manager cannot find your credentials, perhaps you're not at the site you think you're visiting.
 - [ ] Don't share thumb drives and USB devices with people you don't strongly trust.
 - [ ] Try not to use public or shared computers.
